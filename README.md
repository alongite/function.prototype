# Function.prototype polyfill
This is a polyfill for the three basic function methods `apply`, `bind` and
`call` for [ECMAScript 1st Edition (ECMA-262)][1].

That's right, as compatible as it literally can be*. Why do you ask? Well to
prove a point and to show just how much you can do in a dynamic language such
as JavaScript/ECMAScript.

_\*THis means Internet Explorer 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 2.0, yeah way back._
